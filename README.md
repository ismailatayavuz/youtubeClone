# Youtube Clone App
This Youtube Clone Application is built using React Native and replicates YouTube's homepage, showcasing a collection of video thumbnails in a user-friendly format. Video data displayed on the homepage is dynamically fetched from the Rapid API's Youtube v3-alternative API, which is created by "ytdlfree", ensuring that the content is up-to-date and relevant.

Currently, the application consists of a single main screen that replicates the homepage layout of YouTube, and the application does not support video playback or navigation to individual video pages. Therefore it is only focused on the layout. Future iterations will aim to incorporate these functionalities.
